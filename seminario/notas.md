Machine
learning (ML) algorithms can also be used in sev-
eral antenna applications, including the estimation
of antenna characteristics, such as the S-parame-
ters and gain or radiation pattern, and their use
as surrogate methods



It must be
pointed out the common antenna design meth-
ods have several limitations. For example, the
Dolph-Tschebyscheff method is suitable only for
equidistant broadside antenna arrays. Moreover,
the amplitudes obtained by this method are real
numbers, which are difficult to implement in prac-
tice. 



 **na seção de evolutionary algorithms**

The majority of anten-
na design issues fall into one of the two categories.
The first is concerned with determining the optimal
geometry for a particular antenna element, where-
as the second is concerned with optimizing the
locations and excitation of an antenna array. Other
optimization options could be a combination of
the aforementioned issues.

**agora sobre machine learning**



In antenna synthesis, an ML algorithm is mostly
used as a surrogate method for full-wave analysis.
Full-wave EM solvers for modern antennas are time
consuming and require additional computational
power. In order to save time and computational
resources, the use of a surrogate method is com-
mon in antenna literature. The whole method can
be generally described in the following steps (Fig. 3).
• Step 1. The dataset is generated by varying
the antenna geometry and/or the frequency
of operation (input data) by running a full-
wave EM simulator. The output may be S-pa-
rameters, gain, or radiation patterns in one
or more frequencies.
• Step 2. The ML algorithm is trained using
approximately 80 percent of the obtained
dataset.
• Step 3. Tthe testing error is obtained by using
the remaining 20 percent of the dataset (as a
rule of thumb) as input to the ML algorithm.
If the testing error is not satisfactory, return
to step 1, generate more data, or fine-tune
the ML algorithm.
• Step 4. Run the ML algorithm instead of the
full-wave EM simulator in conjunction with
an optimization method (like an EA).
• Step 5. Fine-tune the best obtained design by
rerunning the full-wave EM simulator.
In antenna analysis, a training dataset is also
obtained by running full-wave simulations or
real antenna measurements.
